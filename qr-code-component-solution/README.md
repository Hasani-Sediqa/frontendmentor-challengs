## My process
 As usual, I first started by drawing the project  on the paper, then structured it using HTML5 and style it using CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use external fonts like Google Fonts and creating the responsive page.


```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@100..900&display=swap');
.body {
   font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
}

@media (max-width: 375px){

}
```



### Continued development
I need to focus and learn to use Git and GitHup and responsive websites.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This helped me for creating the responsive page reason. I really liked this pattern.
